Quick run instructions (frontend)

Install dependencies and run the dev server using the Angular CLI (via npx if you don't have it globally):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npx ng serve --open
```

This starts a dev server at `http://localhost:4200` and expects the backend at `http://localhost:8080`.

If you prefer, install `@angular/cli` globally: `npm i -g @angular/cli` and run `ng serve`.
