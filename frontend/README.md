Angular frontend scaffold (minimal)

Recommended: use Angular CLI to generate a full app quickly.

Commands to generate a real Angular app:

  npm install -g @angular/cli
  ng new frontend --routing --style=css
  cd frontend
  ng generate service api/api-client
  ng generate component pages/tasks
  ng generate component pages/users

This repo includes a minimal scaffold for reference and quick prototyping.
